# Daycare & Preschool Feature

while implementing this feature, we had to research the size and amount of pools for these contactcenters. The sources listed are in Dutch since the English version doesn't contain the same information.

For the daycares we found that they consist of one pool with a maximum of 18 babies/toddlers. [[source]](https://www.kindengezin.be/cijfers-en-rapporten/cijfers/kinderopvang-baby-peuter/)

for preschools, we found that there were 265775 students in 2370 preschools, giving an average of 112 students per preschool [[source]](http://ebl.vlaanderen.be/publications/documents/132139). For the used preschool size value, we rounded this number up to 120. To decide on the contact pool size, we used the following quote from Hilde Crevits (Flemish Minister of Education):

> EÃ©n  van de parameters in het omkaderingssysteem is  de aftopping van  de leerling/leerkracht-ratio op 18,5. 

which translates to

> One of the parameters of the framework is the cap of the student/teacher-ratio to 18.5.

Because of this, we chose 20 students as pool size giving a total of 6 pools per preschool.
